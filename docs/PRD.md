## 1. Overview
Folio is a next-generation portfolio and professional networking platform built for cinematographers, filmmakers, and production companies. It bridges the gap between video hosting, professional networking (LinkedIn/IMDb), and production workflow management. Unlike Vimeo or YouTube, Folio treats video as both a creative object and a professional credential, designed specifically for the unique needs of the film and television industry.

## 2. Problem Statement
Cinematographers, production companies, and creative professionals face significant challenges with current portfolio and video-hosting platforms:

- Vimeo was once the only professional alternative to YouTube, but its UI has degraded ("enshittification").
- YouTube enforces strict DMCA compliance, making it unusable for showcasing copyrighted work.
- Neither platform provides film-industry–specific tools or CRM integration.

### Customer pain points
- Cost: Hosting (Vimeo + Squarespace) is expensive and redundant.
- Maintenance: Portfolio upkeep requires constant effort and technical expertise.
- Lack of support: Companies offer no real customer support or feedback loops.
- Limited functionality: Platforms don’t treat videos as professional objects (credits, release tracking, contracts).
- Workflow gaps: No tools exist for invoicing, deal memos, job tracking, or managing multiple employer relationships.

## 3. Goals & Objectives
- Provide a centralized platform where filmmakers can host, showcase, and manage their video portfolios.
- Create a professional network layer (LinkedIn for film) that integrates portfolios, credits, and career history.
- Reduce the cost and complexity of maintaining an online presence by combining hosting, CRM, and portfolio tools.
- Establish direct communication between platform leadership and users to foster trust and growth.
- Offer workflow tools (contracts, invoicing, payment tracking) tailored for film industry realities.

## 4. Core Features

### 1) Portfolio & Hosting
- High-quality video hosting with embeddable playback.
- Vimeo/YouTube-style viewing pages.

### 2) Film Industry Networking

## 5. Additional Features (Phase 2+)

- Invoicing system with multi-format payment support (W2, 1099, wire, PayPal, etc.).

## 6. User Stories
- As a cinematographer, I want to upload my reel and embed it on my personal website so potential clients can view it professionally.
- As a production company, I want to search for collaborators by skills and credits so I can staff projects quickly.
- As a freelancer, I want automatic credit population from call sheets and IMDb so I don’t spend hours updating my portfolio.
- As a professional, I want to invoice clients and track payments within the same platform where I showcase my work.
- As a creative, I want reliable, high-quality hosting without risking takedowns for showcasing copyrighted material in my reel.

## 7. Success Metrics

- Engagement: Avg. monthly portfolio/profile updates.
- Retention: % of users renewing subscriptions annually.
- Workflow penetration: % of users using invoicing/contracts in addition to hosting.

## 8. Risks & Assumptions

- Adoption hurdle: Convincing professionals to migrate from entrenched platforms.
